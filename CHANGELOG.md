# Changelog

All notable changes to Î  Grid Engine will be documented in this file.

## [1.30] - 2025-10-02

### ðŸš€ Major Feature: Multi-Symbol Trading Support

#### Added

- **Multi-Symbol Grid Trading**: `ManageLogic_Grid_MultiSymbol()` function that processes all enabled symbols simultaneously
- **Multi-Symbol Random Trading**: `ManageLogic_Random_MultiSymbol()` function that randomly selects from enabled symbols
- **Symbol-Specific Functions**:
  - `ManageLogic_Grid_ForSymbol()` - Individual symbol grid logic
  - `OpenOrderForSymbol_Grid()` - Grid order placement for specific symbols
  - `OpenOrderForSymbol_Random()` - Random order placement for specific symbols
  - `CheckAndOpenGridOrders_ForSymbol()` - Symbol-specific grid level checking
  - `HasOrderAtPrice_ForSymbol()` - Symbol-specific price level validation

#### Fixed

- **Critical Bug**: Multi-symbol trading now works correctly - previously only the current chart symbol was processed
- **Grid Trading**: Each enabled symbol now maintains its own independent grid structure
- **Random Trading**: Now randomly selects from all enabled symbols instead of only current chart symbol
- **Order Management**: Proper symbol-specific order tracking and management

#### Improved

- **Trading Logic**: Complete separation of single-symbol and multi-symbol trading logic
- **Price Handling**: Each symbol uses its own price data (`MarketInfo()` instead of `SymbolInfo()`)
- **Error Handling**: Enhanced error checking for invalid symbol prices
- **Logging**: More detailed logging with symbol-specific information

#### Technical Changes

- Maintained backward compatibility with original functions
- Added comprehensive multi-symbol support without breaking existing functionality
- Enhanced symbol selector interface integration
- Improved code organization with clear function separation

### ðŸŽ¯ Impact
- **Before**: Only current chart symbol would trade, other enabled symbols were ignored
- **After**: All enabled symbols trade simultaneously according to selected mode (Grid/Random)
- **Grid Mode**: Each symbol maintains independent grid levels and auto-adds positions
- **Random Mode**: Randomly selects symbols from enabled list for each trade interval
